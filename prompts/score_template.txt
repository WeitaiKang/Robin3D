###Human:

Evaluate the request below and determine whether it accurately identifies the target object enclosed within the tags '<Target>' and '</Target>':

<Request>
{}
</Request>

For reference, I have asked for a powerful 3D discriminator machine, it indicates that the request has a {}% likelihood of being accurate in identifying the target object. However, the machine is not always correct, so you need to provide the final determination.

Please respond with the answer in the following format: 'The answer is: True' if the request correctly localizes the target object, or 'The answer is: False' if it does not.
